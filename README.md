# MonsterGame
Pokemon clone game Java project

started out as a simple text based monster fight with 2 random monsters,
I've been adding on to the game as I learn how to do stuff/get new ideas,
I don't really know how to make nice graphics yet, so graphics are done with javafx

Currently the game is basically:
start new game (or load saved game),
enter player name,
choose starting monster from 3 options,
battle wild monsters to gain xp and level up,
buy items from the shop, catch wild monsters,
check and use the items in your bag,
check your monster team and their stats/change team leader/change monster name/release monster,
get quests randomly after defeating wild monsters, quests can be: fight x wild monsters(specific or unspecific type) or battle a trainer,
player score goes up after defeating monsters and completing quests,
save game, return to title screen
